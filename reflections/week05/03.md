## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
- time management

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
- I have not followed a time-boxing strategy for tasks. I tend to work till I feel I need a break or I hit a wall, check the time, go for 10 more mins at it and either take a break or move to a different part of the project.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
- Yesterdays hackathon would have benefited from some timeboxing so that I didn't hog the keyboard from my partner. I do feel like I did most of the work and he didn't have the oportunities to code that he probalby should have had.
